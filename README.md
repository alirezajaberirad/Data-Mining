# Data-Mining
 
This repository contains 3 exercises. The codes are all written in Python in Jupiter notebook IDE. The HTML and ipynb files in each folder are same files with different formats.

## Data Visualization
In this assignment Matplotlib and Pandas dataframe features were used to visulaize a dataset properly.

## Diabetes Diagnosis using Tree-based Algorithms
In this exercise, two models were implemented for diabetes diagnosis. The first model was base on C4.5 algorithm and the second one wase base on Random Forest algorithm.

## Dimentionality Reduction (DR)
In this exercise, PCA algorithm used to obtain dimentionality reduction on the dataset. The dataset is the famous people dataset of the sklearn library. After dimensionality reduction, the resultant dataset was fed to two models: 1. Support Vector Machine and 2. Neural Network
Finaly the result of two models in different cases of DR was reported.
